**Kubernetes vs. Amazon ECS**

Amazon ECS provides two solutions in one serviceâ€”a container orchestration tool and a fully managed service that automatically provisions underlying infrastructure resources. In contrast, Kubernetes requires you to provision resources in the cloud or on premises.

**Can I use Docker Swarm instead of Kubernetes?**

Docker Swarm is Docker's native orchestration solution and provides basic orchestration capabilities. While it can handle simple deployments, Kubernetes offers more advanced features, scalability, and a larger ecosystem. If you have complex requirements or anticipate future scalability needs, Kubernetes is generally recommended over Docker Swarm.
